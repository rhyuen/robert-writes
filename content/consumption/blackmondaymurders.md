## Summary

## Volume 1

Daniel Ackerman is found dead in the Penthouse of a building.  Signs from a thousands of years ago are painted on the walls in his blood.  Detective Dumas is called in to investigate.  Viktor Eresko is the primary suspect as he's the only one seen entering the same room as Mr. Ackerman.  Eresko's flunkies were in tow, but Eresko is the main suspect.  The reader sees in a flashback that Eresko commited the murder and drew the signs.  Detective Dumas, acknowledging his suspect's power and influence, and requests the truth from Eresko, who has a Caina lawyer in the room.  Eresko obliges.  He stabs himself with a pen after he screams to the Caina lawyer to not touch him.  Eresko says some of the ancient symbols and the lawyer falls into a trance.  Eresko commands him to bang his head on the table until he says otherwise.  Eresko advises Dumas to look into why so many financial traders die each year instead of just Daniel Ackerman.

Due to Daniel's death, Grigoria (Ria) Ackerman, Daniel's fraternal twin, is welcomed back from exile to take her brother's place.  We learn that Ria was exiled after learning that there was a failed attempt at stealing power form the other Banks/Academies.  The punishment was Ria be exiled, as Daniel originally wanted to walk away from the secret society life.  We learn that the Ackerman's parents were killed by their grandfather after their father married a 'commoner'.  The patriarch disliked the diluting of the royal blood and killed and drank his son's blood.  His son's wife was killed in a different manner.  Eventually, Ria sees the Abby (the familiar) eat her grandfather.

At her brother's funeral, Ria rebukes all the other families/academies in attendance for no why allying with her when she was exiled.

## Volume 2

In a flashback, we learn that Daniel, like Thomas Dane, is disappointed in the world.  Together, they try to secret away money to at least do a little good in the world.  Dane comes to serve Ria after interrogating him and receiving a truthful answer.

The Professor and Detective Dumas go to the Federal Reserve to meet Mammon, who is god it seems.  The professor pays for the two of them go and ask questions of Mammon.  When they are out of time to ask questions, the professor requests more time and says that he is willing to pay more.  The Professor asks Mammon to enumerate the years of the market crashes that he has caused upon his waking.  Mammon does.  The Professor notices that one of the dates of a market crash is missing: 1987.  He comes to the conclusion that someone has manufactured a crash.  Mammon then consumes the professor's body as additional payment.  Dumas goes to see Ria.

Ria, using her familiar, Abby, kills Oresko in a magic duel for all of the other's power.  She eats his heart when she wins, claiming his power and reclaiming her brother's power for herself.

Dumas goes to Ria and tells her that Oresko killed her brother.  Exasperated as to why and how this is happening, he asks to be let into her world.  She obliges.

In the epilogue, Thomas Dane finds Wynn Ackermann and says that Ria says that he can come home now.
