# Details about me reading it and other things about the book.

I finished the book on June 9/21. I borrowed it from the VPL.  The book is by Malcolm Gladwell.  It's not his usual pop psychology book.  It's fairly short at 185 pages according to Google.


# Contents (Plot and Spoilers/Details)

> The below is based on my memory after finishing reading it and written some time between June 9, 21 and the post date.  Misremembering/incorrectness is my mistake.

The book is about the founders of the US Air Force striving for an ideal of a better means of waging war.  They wanted to try to avoid throwing men into trenches and having them die grim and gruesome deaths like they did in World War 1.

In order to do that they needed air superiority.

Air superiority at the time wasn't a thing.  People didn't grasp the notion of using planes in war or didn't viscerally understand the strategic advantage it was capable of giving them.  They only saw it as a means of supporting the army.  The US air force was part of the US Army at the time.

In order to achieve air superiority, they needed to be able to drop bombs accurately on targets from great distances in the air, whilst accounting for wind, movement, anti-air armaments, the rotation of the planet and other factors.  To do that they spent oodles of money devising a brief case sized targeting mechanism that would do that.

If I recall correctly, there was a comparison between reaching the 'idealism' of fighting in war using a better means as opposed to a sort of pragmatism that eventually ended up happening.  This occurred when, one of the founders/early members of the air force that was a 'true believer' of the air superiority concept, leading the bombing against Japan was replaced with a non-founder of the Air Force.  

I think he was dismissed due to losing a bunch of planes repeatedly when trying to bomb japan as the fleet had quite the arduous flight to japan either over the Himalayas or another zone where the jetstream was preventing them from getting to their destination.  In other words, there was a high expenditure of resources for low damage to enemy targets.  Coincidentally, the world didn't know about the jetstream at that time.  However, I think one academic did write a paper on it, except it was using some weird academic script that was popular at the time so very few people read it.  

Napalm was devised during World War 2 in the US by some academics.  It was eventually used to firebomb most of Japan, primarily targetting civilian areas.

The replacement, I think his name was Le May, ended up flying the fleet during the day to Japan, which wasn't defended well by air.  They ended up bombing most of the major cities of Japan causing massive losses of life and excessive amounts of damage (> 50%).  The atomic bombs dropped in Japan some time during the campaign of firebombing.  This resulted in the surrender of Japan before the winter, which was earlier than anticipated.


# Summary

Thoughts, overall I thought it was interesting and I learned some stuff.  I suspected that using napalm against civilians was a war crime.  I searched and it seems I was correct.  The first link from 'is napalm a war crime' on google from 'https://napalmbiography.com' states that it is.  Though I didn't click on the link.
