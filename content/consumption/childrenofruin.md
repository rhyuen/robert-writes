## Details about me reading it and other things about the book.

Finished the book on June 16, 21. I took around 1.5 weeks to finish.  It's shorter than its predecessor [Children of Time](/consumption/childrenoftime) but I found that it was putting me to sleep in the middle chapters.

## Characters (Spoilers and Details)

Present

- Helena, the previous human protagonists child.
- Human Male, whose name escapes me.
- Fabian, Spider/Portid Science Male, similar to his predecessor
- Portia, spider/Portid Explorer/Adventurer Female, similar to her predecessor.
- Kern, AI from the previous novel that was formerly human.  Is powered by ant circulatory system signals in lieu of integrated circuits.  She's the AI of the Voyager ship as well as the shuttle that is forked from the Voyager ship.
- Alien, the alien hive mind on the non-terraformed world.  Their name escapes me.

Past (After the fall of the Earth empire but before the Humans show up to the new planet)

- Leader of Terraforming Project whose name escapes me
- Senkovi, A crew member of the Terraforming Project. He creates intelligent octopods similar to Kern and her portids.
