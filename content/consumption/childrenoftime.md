## About the book (Children of Time)

A scifi book that follows the journey of colonists leaving earth after it has been polluted and damaged beyond repair, as well as the development of a sentient species of spiders made that way due to a nanovirus from earth.

Google says the book is around 600 pages long.  Each chapter/section alternates between the perspectives of the humans and spiders.  Once or twice, there is a chapter from the perspective of Dr. Kern.

It took me around a week to finish it.  I finished on June 7th, 2021.

## Characters (Spoilers)

Avrana Kern.  An eccentric, prideful scientist that has designs to inject a nanovirus into monkeys and allow them time to evolve to a level at parity with the human race.  

Holsten Mason.  The classicist on the Gilgamesh.

Isa Lain.  Chief engineer on the Gilgamesh.

Guyen Vrie.  Captain of the Gilgamesh and leader of the last of the humans.

Portia: a name typically carried by a warrior spider through the evolution of the spider species.  Throughout the book we follow a spider character named portia.  This occurs over thousands of years and each chapter/section follows a different spider but all of which are named Portia.  This is the case for the other spiders below as well.  

Bianca: a spider, typically, with eccentric/analytical and science based traits.

Fabian: a spider, that is usually closely allied with Portia to an extent.  Eventually becomes a pioneer of female and male spider equality.

## Plot (Spoilers)

Doctor Kern along with her team are preparing to seed a terraformed world with a monkey species imbued with a nano-virus that will facilitate the evolution of the species to a level of intelligence and development similar to that of the human race.  This is happening while political unrest led by a terrorist political group opposed to the development of exoplanets for human usage.  The terrorists release a virus that incapacitates all technology that it encounters.  This results in all human settlements already in development to fail in the vacuum of space.  Earth society largely ultimately fails and enters a dark age.  One of these terrorists is among Kern's crew.  He attempts to blow up the ship citing that humans shouldn't play god or something to that effect after revealing is plans for the ship.  Kern makes it to a satellite that can store a human being for extended periods of time that was to be deployed with the monkeys for observation of their development in place of the person who was supposed to make it onto the satellite.  Everyone on the ship (and the monkeys) dies except Kern.  She decides to send a distress beacon and wait for help (not knowing that help will not come) as well as wait for the evolution of her monkeys on the world below (except that they never got around to sending the monkeys to the planet and the nanovirus mistakenly ended up finding a home in spiders and other arthropods).  She has the probe's AI build itself based on her personality, which also conveniently saves her from the virus that is spammed to all humans by the technology zealots.

After the upheaval on Earth, and the ice that developed thawed to sufficient degree, humanity sets out to explore the stars on the Gilgamesh again looking for a new home, using the previously developed technology that had been lost and poorly rediscovered.

On Kern's World, the planet that Kern orbits, spiders have been infected by the human nano virus.  They become sentient and work together.  Fellow sentient spiders reproduce as dictated by the nano-virus.  Each generation becomes smarter and accumulates experiences that are passed on via something called 'Understandings'.

The spiders encounter ants, the predominant predator on the planet. They steal an artifact from the ants that receive signals from the Kern's satellite.  They worship it.  The messages that the probe sends are questions that test for the developing species' knowledge and degree of development.

The ants expand develop more and are encrouching on the spiders territory, to the point of eventual extinction.  With the discovery of a Bianca spider and with the help of Portia, the spiders find a means of co-opting ants to do their bidding staving off extinction and increasing their productivity exponentially.



- spiders going to be wiped out due to a pandemic
    - they isolate a vaccine from newbornes that survived in a pandemic infested area
    - they also locate the nanovirus in their genome
- spiders figure out how to use ants programatically to multiply their manpower exponentially
    - the spider that figures it out uses it as leverage to gain equal rights for male spiders.
- while all this is happening, the spiders worship the probe that dr. kern is in as god. 
- at some point they communicate with it.  She tries to get them to build a computer but they can't quite manage it 
- after seeing that they're spiders because the spiders sent a picture, Kern tells them that the humans are coming to invade their planet and exterminate their race.


- humans show up at kern's world. 
- they are rebuked by kern and told to leave .  she fires a laser at them
- they leave and head to another terraformed site with data given to them by kern to entice them into leaving and drop off an outpost, with plans for the main group to return back to kern's world
- they discover an old empire outpost with working technology that they have never found before.  Including a conscience storage device.  Vrie's interest is piqued by it.

- there's a revolt of people not wanting to be dropped off at a subideal terraformed world outpost because they feel it'd be doomed cause.
- the revolt fails and the inhabitants of the settlement are forced into the colony
- vrien tries to attain immortality, with Isa in opposition.
- immmortality fails for vrie and we find out that Isa and Holsten are with child.  Isa charges Holsten with securing a settlement on Kern's world for their unborn child.
- the ship has been outfitted for invading kern's world.
