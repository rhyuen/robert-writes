## Preamble

Daredevil from the library.  Five issues per volume.  The events of what happens in each comic.  __Spoilers__ obviously.

## Vol 1

Daredevil recovers from dying or being hit by a truck.  He goes out on patrol in New York after a long hiatus and accidentally kills a robber of a group of robbers pillaging a liquor store.  

Daredevil goes around town and questions people that he believe may have framed him in the accidental killing of the robber.

Cole North, a new detective from Chicago, is brought in to arrest Daredevil.  They get into a fistfight and Daredevil loses.  He's saved by the Punisher and brought back to his lair, kind of happy that Daredevil has come over to his kind of thinking.  Daredevil decries that he isn't a killer and beats Punisher and blows up his lair.  Daredevil then steals the Punisher's shirt and goes to a gang's (Owlsbey) stronghold and picks a fight with the entire gang.  During the brawl, Daredevil tells himself that he does this to help people.  As he's getting overwhelmed, the Defenders intervene and save him.

At the Defenders home, Daredevil resolves and comes to the realization that he killed the robber accidentally and that was no foul play or conspiracy by his enemies to frame him.  Daredevil says that he's ready and glad that his friends are arresting him for the murder.  The defenders say that they've all accidentlaly killed someone during their work and they only saved him from the gang because he seemed unwell.  Daredevil accuses them all of being murderers and leaves.  Daredevil recovers at his apartment post-escape.  Spider-man is there to meet him.  Spider-man asks/demands that Daredevil retire, and admits that he, too, has accidentally killed someone in his work.
Daredevil gives Spider-man his mask.

## Vol 2

They changed artists/pencillers for this volume.  I'm not thrilled.

Matt Murdock retires from being Daredevil and becomes a parole officer.  He also becomes smitten and has an affair with a bookstore owner who happens to be married to a gangster's son.  Murdock is also the parole officer to the brother of the robber he killed in volume 1 and has a panic attack upon learning this.

The Kingpin quits being the kingpin and becomes a legitimate businessman/mayor.  He divies up his old empire amongst the other crime lords.  He wants to expedite the legalization of cannabis along with the governor.

Cole North's partner is beaten and ultimately accidentally killed as retaliation by corrupt cops for Cole 'killing' Daredevil.  After clearing out the police station and cornering him, the corrupt cops attempt to kill Cole.  They fail and Murdock happened to be in the building when they make this assassination attempt.  He helps Cole not be killed.  Cole comes to the realization that the man that helps him against the corrupt cops is Daredevil.  Murdock offers to leave in front of the cameras to allow the blame of the corrupt cops attack against Cole to fall on him.

## Vol 3

Fisk is invited to a lunch with the Stronwyns (richest family in the United States).  Whilst there, Fisk is poked and prodded verbally by the Stronwyns and their friends on how he earned his wealth as well as his stature.  Embarassed, Kingpin goes to the restroom.  One of the Stronwyn's friends finds him leaving the washroom and makes some more jokes about his size.  In a rage, Kingpin strangles the man and kills him.  Wesley covers the murder up.  In response to the killing of their friend and having the authorities poke around their home, the Stronwyns arrange for the Kingpin to be beaten by mercenaries in their personal office and their thrown from the windows.

Daredevil is trained by Elektra.  They interrogate the governor of New York for information.  They also rob the Stronwyns and look into why the police are not permitted in Hell's Kitchen.  

## Vol 4

The brother of the thug that Daredevil killed tells his mother that his parole officer is Daredevil.  After the Kitchen Windfall, Murdock pays the mother a visit.  She tells him that he knows he's Daredevil and that she forgives him for killing her son because she knows that he's genuinely sorry and that he will carry the death with him forever.

The Libris' granddaughter is kidnapped by Owlsbey as he attempts to solidify his hold amongst the crime families.  Daredevil and Cole find and rescue the daughter.  Tom Libris (the son of the Libris Matriarch) confronts Owlsbey but is killed by Owlsbey upon finding out that the granddaughter has been rescued.

The Stronwyns order mercenaries into Hell's Kitchen to destroy it due to them seeing that Fisk cannot control his city.  A litany of fake daredevils come out to defend their home.  Daredevil reclaims his mask and fights the mercenaries.  Sister Elizabeth turns out to be Typhoid Mary and reveals herself to defend the church against the Rhino.  Fisk also comes out of his office to fight off the mercenaries.  Daredevil hands himself in to the authorities for having accidentally killed Leo Carrero.

## Vol 5

Daredevil pleads guilty to manslaughter.  He goes to prison as Daredevil and not Matt Murdock.  He only pleads guilty after he hears that Elektra bought a number of properties in Hell's Kitchen to keep them out of the hands of the Stronwyns.  She had to outbid Tony Stark, who Murdock had bid as high as he could for the same properties, unbeknownst to both Murdock and Stark.  Elektra becomes Daredevil for Hell's Kitchen after visiting Murdock in prison and him refusing to join the Fist.  She wants to convince him to become the leader of the Fist, the opposite of the Hand, along with her so that one of them can fall and an old prophecy can come true.
