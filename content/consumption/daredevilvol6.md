## Preamble

Daredevil from the library.  __Spoilers__ obviously.

## Summary

The first issue of the volume is a `King in Black` tie in where Daredevil becomes infested with a Knull symbiote.  Daredevil is able to maintain control of his body for moments while he gets himself to an electric chair to remove the symbiote.  His control falters just before he's able to turn on the chair.  A fellow inmate turns the chair on.  That displaces the symbiote.  Elektra, as Daredevil, defends a foster child from her foster mother, who has been infested with a knull symbiote.  The mother relentlessly pursues the child, hoping to infest her with a symbiote as well.  An infested Typhoid Mary seeks to kill Elektra/Daredevil.  In pursuit of Elektra, Mary kills the child's mother to get to Elektra.  Mary throws Elektra throw a building.  Elektra has stopped breathing and Mary relinquishes control of her body entirely to Knull, having completed her task.  Elektra is still alive, having fooled Mary.  Elektra takes it upon herself to mentor the now-orphan Alice.

Elektra foils a pair of racketeering gangsters.  She tells them that if the Kingpin (not Wilson Fisk) wants to run her racket in her neighbourhood then she needs to pay 30K/month.  The Kingpin appoints Butch, Wilson Fisk's son, as the new head of Hell's Kitchen.  The Kingpin fears losing another soon in gang violence.

An inmate that was convicted by Murdock of double homicide is looking for friendship with Daredevil.  Daredevil is unable to deal with that with the overwhelming noise in the prison and brushes him off.  Later, in the showers, the inmate is attacked by other inmates.  Murdock arrives in time to stop the assault.  The next day the attacked inmate kills himself.  In the mandated therapy sessions, Murdock finds out that the inmate killed himself and he becomes distraught as he sees himself as responsible for his death since he was the one that prosecuted him.  

Later, Murdock is eating and consumes poison.  He is escorted outside by a corrupt guard for 'fresh air', where he is met with a slew of inmate ready to kill him.  Murdock defeats all of the inmates, but is greviously stabbed as he finishes up dispatching the last inmate.  He finds himself in the hospital surrounded by his lawyers.  They've offered him a deal of cooperation in exchange for early release.  Murdock is stubborn and insists that he'll cooperate but still wants to serve the full duration of his sentence.

Elektra takes Alice with her to a nightclub that she owns to confront Butch who's selling drugs in the rented out nightclub.  An enforcer appears to dispatch her.  Elektra struggles to stop the enforcer without killing him.  Ultimately, the enforcer is stopped with Alice picks up a fumbled gun and shoots the enforcer in an attempt to help Elektra.  The enforcer dies and it turns out to have been an agent of the Hand.  The pair flee.

## Notes

They had different artists for the panels with Murdock and Elektra.  Elektra had the better artist.
