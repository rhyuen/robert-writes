## Summary

It's 2001, Marcus detoxes Saya.  Marcus, unbeknownst to Saya, is under the employment of her brother, who wants to kill her when she's least expecting it.  Marcus and Saya make a plan to kill her brother.  Marcus reveals to Saya that he's under her brother's employment.  Marcus offers Saya a choice: spare her brother and leave the mercenary life or kill her brother and take her place at the head of her clan.  Marcus leaves the room to give her time to make her choice.  He returns to find Saya's brother decapitated and a note addressed to him.

In 2006, Marcus takes a job to kill a major gang leader.  He succeeds but is surrounded. Maria appears.  It's revealed that Maria hired Marcus to kill her husband, the gang leader.  Maria attempts to get the people pursuing Marcus for killing their leader.  However, the gang turns on Maria and attempts to kill both Maria and Marcus.  They escape from the gang together.

One year later, Marcus and Maria are back in the United States and no longer mercenaries.  Marcus is now a writer for free at a local newspaper.  However, they're now poor and Maria has been afflicted with an expensive chronic illness that impairs her motor functions.  Marcus contemplates returning to contract killing.

With Maria's disease progressing, Marcus takes Maria on a vacation.  He proposes to her and they get married in Las Vegas, with three of their former classmates as witnesses.  A fourth classmate attends remotely.  Him and his spouse are killed by a mysteriously assailant.
