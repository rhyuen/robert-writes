## Plot

The war that was instigated at the end fo the first book is going poorly.  After intercepting an alien communication, Nine Hibiscus sends for an Information Ministry agent to be sent to figure out how to communicate with the aliens.  Three Seagrass volunteers, hoping to see Mahit Dzmare, who has returned home to Lsel Station, which is situated next to the war.  Seagrass hitchhikes on numerous cargoships in order to get to Lsel Station and request Dzmare's company/assitance as quickly as possible.

Dzmare faces a political situation in which the Cultural Minister (in charge of all the Imagos, and who we find was the one who sabotaged Dzmare's imago) wants to download the memories and experiences of Dzmare into the station's repository of memories.  However, Dzmare, having had to have a second imago implanted after the first one failed, feels she would probably be killed after the Cultural Minister finds that the first imago failed and a second was illegally installed.  

Three Seagrass arrives and enlists Dzmare in her mission, which delays the download of Dzmare's memories.  Together, they journey to the `Weight for the Wheel` where Three Seagrass has been assigned.
