## Details about me reading it and other things about the book

I finished the book on June 21/21. I borrowed it from the VPL.  The book is by Daniel H. Pink.  

## Contents (Plot and Spoilers/Details)

> The below is based on my memory after finishing reading it and written some time between June 9, 21 and the post date.  Misremembering/incorrectness is my mistake.

So, writing a post five months after finishing a book isn't a good idea. Apparently, I was going to dump what I learned from the book into this section here; however, I don't really remember anything about the book at this point.  And the only thing I wrote from five months ago were my thoughts below.  This is disappointing.

## Thoughts

The last part of the book reads like a listicle.  I didn't enjoy it much.  It seemed kind of surface level.  However, the whole attributing payment to something in exchange for labour kills intrinsic motivation was interesting and not something I knew or at least was not aware of to the extent that the author details in the book.
