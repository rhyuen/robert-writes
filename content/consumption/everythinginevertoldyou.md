# Notes

Spoilers and plot below, some of which probably aren't that accurate since I finished writing this over a month (may 25) after I finished reading it (april 18).  Book is by [Celeste Ng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celeste_Ng)

## About

Takes place in the 70s and covers an interracial asian/caucasian family living in a small college town.  The family's prized daughter has gone missing and been found dead in the middle of the lake that is across the street from their family home.

## Plot

Our cast of characters is the asian, professor husband, the caucasian housewife with previous aspirations for a career as a doctor, the eldest son with plans for space, the recently deceased prized middle daughter and the oft-ignored youngest daughter.  There's also the rebellious next door neighbour who the son suspects of having something do with the death of his sister.

Before being married, the wife aspires to be a doctor, despite her mother having designs for her to be a housewife.  She goes to college and meets her future husband, an asian professor teaching American history.  They fall in love and the wife ends up getting pregnant and they get married before the wife gets an opportunity to finish her undergraduate degree.  Just prior to the marriage, the husband hears his future mother in law's disapproval of their union unbeknownst to the wife.  This sits at the back of his mind throughout their marriage.

They settle in a college town and live their life and have two children.  All is well until the wife finds out that her mother has passed and she returns to her childhood home to tie up loose ends.  Whilst there, she has an epiphany that she's abandoned her original plans and yearns for the road not travelled.  Initially, she planned to work in a lab at the university her husband works at however the position was filled by someone else after the employer thinking that she proposed the idea of working in the lab as a joke. Eventually, She hatches a plan to secretely run away to finish her undergraduate degree.  She runs away one day without leaving a note though there was an attempt to do so before being abandoned.

The family tries for months and months to look for their runaway mother.  Eventually, she is discovered part way through the semester after she ends up in the hospital due to a surprise pregnancy (the youngest, not yet born).

Whilst the mother is missing, the family is in turmoil and the two children take it particularly hard, the daughter in particular.  She makes a promise to herself that she'll do whatever her mother wishes as long as she comes back. When the mother is found in the hospital, she makes good on her self promise, which ultimately results in her death.

The mother returns home and resigns herself to not becoming a doctor.  Instead, she places all her hopes and dreams into her eldest daughter, who, trying to fulfill her self promise, dutifully fulfills them, until she gets to high school where she can no longer keep up to the expectations of her mother.  At this point she begins skipping school and hanging out with the neighbourhood hoodlum.

We find out that the son has aspirations for Harvard.  He applies and gets in.  The eldest daughter doesn't want to be left alone and have no one understand her.  The son's relationship with his father is tenuous at best.  The son is like his father in that he is brainy and has no friends.  His father wants him to not be like him and doesn't assist him in getting along with others or open up to him with respect to his experiences with racism.  His son has to shoulder it all on his own.

Shorly after the son gets back from his weekend visit to Harvard, the eldest daughter is found dead in the lake.  In his grief, the father has affair with his grad student.  The son suspects the local hoodlum of having something to do with his sister's death and the mother is in denial.  

The affair comes out and words are exchanged.  We find out that when the mother was younger she wanted to stand out and by standing out there was a lot of opposition from others.  She shares that she was picked on by the other boys in her male dominated science classes.  We find out that the father just wanted to belong and not stand out.

The son gets into a fight with the hoodlum with the youngest sister getting them to stop.  We find out that the hoodlum didn't do it because he's in an unrequited love with the brother, which the eldest sister found out during one of their last outings together.  Also, the eldest daughter didn't want the youngest to bend herself to anyone else's wishes, like she was.

It is revealed that the eldest daughter wanted to take control of her life by proving to herself that she could swim from the middle of the nearby lake back to shore on her own, despite never having succesfully swam before.  The lake was chosen because she determined that to be the origin place where a significant change in her life occurred with her brother and a turning point in her outlook on life.  Sadly, she doesn't make it back to shore, prompting the events of the book.
