## About

Graphic novels I borrowed and read from the library on January 19.  Oddly, this one didn't have issues or chapters.  It was just on long story. Spoilers follow.

## Summary

## Volume 1

Owen Johnson, orphan, with only a picture of his parents, journeys by himself through a mountain looking for someone who may more details of the picture and the people they depict.

He finds himself at the entrance to the martial arts temple, fatigued and starved.  He has to fight the master of the temple for entrance.  He successfully impresses him enough to be allowed to stay and train at the temple.

After training and living with the other trainees, he learns that there's a supposed dragon that can end the world being held captive at the temple and it's the temple's occupants duty to ensure that the dragon stays captive.  Also, the master's goal at the temple is to relearn the lost art of throwing fire.  

Johnson eventually learns from the master that his father used to be friends with the master and trained at the temple until the father met Johnson's mother who was a member of the Scorched-Earth clan.  The Scorched-Earth clan's goal is to release the supposed mythical dragon from captivity.  Johnson learns that his father defected to the Scorched-Earth clan because of Johnson's mother.  After it was revealed that Johnson is a descendant of Scorched-Earth clan members, he is largely avoided by others, except when his bullied by some of the older students.
Eventually, they come to accept him again.

The Scorched-Earth clan attacks from a blimp when Johnson is partaking in a basketball game.  A former friend attacks the master and kills the dragon-keeper, the person that guards the dragon, during the raid.  When the master was also about to be killed by the former friend, Johnson dispatches him with a fireball.  The Scorched-Earth clan members then retreat with fireball-marred clan member.  The book ends with a fifteen year time skip where Johnson is married with two kids and still able to control his ability to create flames.

## Volume 2

We find out that Zan died after leaving the temple, which is why Owen did not marry her.  Zan discovered a book in the temple and learned that the Scorched Earth Clan is actually trying to destroy the Dragon the Fireball clan is protecting.  She told people but they didn't listen.  Disillusioned, she left the clan. She is later found dead at the entrance to the mountain temple.  Owen was seen as the primary suspect by the others and left the clan life behind.

Ma Guang (the rival) finds Owen and requests that he comes back to the temple.  Owen refuses.  Ma Guang returns to the temple stating that he failed to convince Owen to return.  The person that Ma Guang reports to sends assassins to silence Owen.

We find out that Wen Lu (the master) knew what Zan learned from the book and left the temple as well.  He eventually joins the Scorched Earth Clan.  Owen and his family end up on the run due to the assassins sent by Ma Guang's master.  They end up meeting with Wen Lu who elaborates on the significance of the book that Zan found.  The assassins show up.  The Johnson family runs.  Wen Lu is killed as the family escapes.

## Overall

I thought it was okay.  The art was good.  There was a greater emphasis placed on showing via image rather than exposition during the mountain climb.
