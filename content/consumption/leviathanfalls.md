## Preamble

The last book in the expanse series of books.  I borrowed it from the library and finished it in about two weeks on February 2, 2022.

## Summary

After being more integrated with the protomolecule in the last book, Duarte became unresponsive.  In the prologue of this book, he recovers from the initial drawbacks of the protomolecule enhancements.  He's now capable of projecting his image across galaxies like Detective Miller did with Holden.  Duarte leaves Laconia and enters an egg-shaped ship and leaves the planet.  No one knows where he went and a search by Colonel Tanaka of Laconia is soon undertaken to find his whereabouts.

Tanaka follows Duarte's path to the egg ship on Laconia.  With a dead end, she surmises Duarte is likely to come into contact with his daughter Teresa, who absconded in the Rocinante with Holden in the last book.  She charts a course for a boarding school in one of the more obscure ring systems, hoping to find her there.

The Rocinante crew had in fact registered Teresa for a spot at the boarding school that Tanaka is on her way to.  Teresa doesn't want to go to the school; however, everyone on the crew feels it would be best for a sixteen year old to not grow up on a warship, so off she goes.

On the planet, the Rocinante crew are ambushed by Tanaka, who demands that Teresa return to Laconia with her.  Negotiations quickly fall apart and a firefight breaks out.  As Holden, Teresa and Amos return to the Rocinante, they presume all the attackers are dead.  However, Tanaka was not killed.  She shoots a bullet through Amos and his heart pops out.  Holden shoots her in the head.  The crew leave after pulling Amos' corpse onto the ship.

The Rocinante crew go to the Freehold system, where the Gathering Storm is hidden, and meet up with Jillian and the crew of the Gathering Storm.  Amos comes back to life because of the builder tech that brought him back to life the first.  Tanaka did not die.  She follows Holden and the crew to the Freehold system where she meets up with the Derecho which was already situated in the system.

The Derecho is preparing to bombard Freehold with missiles if they don't turn over details on the nearby resistance members within three hours.  Admiral Trejo releases a public broadcast directed to Naomi Nagata of an offer for an armistice between Laconia and the Resistance in exchange for returning Teresa to the Derecho.  The armisitice would also stop the bombing of Freehold.  The Rocinante crew deny taking the armistice.  They are then trapped in their quarters on the station when Jillian claims as the head of the military faction of the resistance feels compelled to agree to the armistice.

Tanaka enters the station to retrieve Teresa from Jillian.  Tanaka, still smarting from being shot in the face, proceeds to renege on the armistice and proceeds to kill everyone on the station.  Jillian, realizing the error she made, releases the Rocinante crew from their quarters.  They flee on the Rocinante and head for the Adro system where Elvi is studying the BFD.  Jillian, in the Gathering Storm, destroys the ship Tanaka arrived at the station in.  However, the Gathering Storm is destroyed by the Derecho.  The Derecho pursues the Rocinante but it loses them.

On the Falcon, Elvi's ship, Amos joins Cara on a dive into the BFD.  Duarte appears as a hologram to everyone present for the experiment.  He also appears to Teresa.  Duarte says that a hive mind of the human species is required to stop the other dimension attackers.  After the experiment, Amos tells Elvi to stop the experiments with Cara and Xan.  Elvi complies.  Naomi agrees to the armistice initially profferred by Trejo.  He was not pleased to find out that Elvi was working with the Resistance.  The resistance comes to the conclusion that Duarte is on the station in the center of the ring.

Kitt, Amos' son, along with his family, is immigrating to a new planet.  While passing through the Ring, their ship was about to go Dutchman and be destroyed.  However, it was stopped mid-process.  This was Duarte's doing.  However, the people in the ring during that time were intentionally, by Duarte, linked in a hive mind.  They all slowly lose sense of themselves.  This hive mind is spreading to other humans who weren't in the ring during the dutchman event as well.  Tanaka is especially affected and stabs a Doctor's eye out.  She sees a therapist who prescribes her a series of drugs that can dull the effects of the intrusive thoughts and memories from the integration into the hive mind.  Tanaka takes the entire pharmacy's supply of the station that she's on when she leaves for the ring station to meetup with the Rocinante to get Duarte.  

Unable to enter the ring station, Holden injects himself with protomolecule and sees Detective Miller again.  Holden, Tanaka and Teresa enter the ring station with the help of Miller via the protomolecule.  Whilst this is happening, the ships in the ring space are preparing for attack by hive mind controlled ships intent on stopping Holden and company from reaching Duarte.  Naomi coordinates defence plans with the ships under her command, whilst all of her forces struggle to remain themself and not join the hive mind themselves.  As such, everyone is popping the anti-thought intrusion drugs on a periodic basis, hopeful for a future where they will have to deal with consequences of the pills.

Holden, Tanaka and Teresa find Duarte.  They fail to convince Duarte to stop the hive mind from growing.  Teresa tries to pull her father out of the ring station's interface.  He attacks her.  The ring station's sentinels attack the group and Tanaka fights them off.  Tanaka attacks and kills Duarte.  Duarte deals a fatal blow to Tanaka. Tanaka's only regret is that she couldn't kill Holden before she died.  The hive mind growth and the intrusive thoughts having stopped, the attacks from the other dimension still need to be addressed.  Holden, trying to maintain a semblance of self, enters the interface Duarte previously used.

- elvi and roc crew pick earth
- amos joins kitt in the new ring gate system.
- holden shutsdown the ring space and the protomolecule eats him.
- 1000 years from now when descendants meet up, amos greets the visitor.

## Thoughts
It was okay.  The book was shorter than the other ones.  The ending was bittersweet.  It was a surprise to see that Amos was alive a millenium from the end of the last chapter.
