## About

Graphic novel by Mark Millar that I borrowed and read from the library. I finished the book on January 17. Spoilers follow.

## Summary

Roscoe, Rosa and Chevy are the stars of this story.

The book starts with a man, in 1985, speeding through and crashing into a building.  He is promptly arrested.

In present day, Roscoe, who deals drugs for Samurai Sal and who has aspirations for bigger and better things, is arrested in the act of a drug deal and surrounded by officers.  He's arrested, convicted and sentenced to fifteen years in prison.  His best friend Chevy visits Roscoe in prison and says that, whilst intoxicated, Samurai Sal was bragging about how he setup Roscoe so he could have a shot at Rosa, Roscoe's girlfriend.  With the odds of getting out of prison early reduced due to fighting with other inmates, Roscoe takes up his cellmate's offer of partaking in some recreational drugs (MPH).  He takes one pill and his perception of time slows to a crawl.  He escapes prison and takes the rest of the pills with him.

Roscoe rights a wrong and donates to charities all the money Hal made from selling drugs away.  Roscoe proceeds to tell Rosa, Chevy and eventually Baseball (Rosa's brother) about MPH and, together, they all rob banks to get rich.  In response to super powered people running the length of the country in minutes, the Federal authorities request the first identified superhuman for help, the man arrested in the building in 1985.  He's been incarcerated for 30 years and he accepts their offer.

One day, Baseball runs through the White House to snoop for classified information on aliens and whatnot.  His MPH powers suddenly stop working and security notices him.  He traps himself in the washroom, seconds away from capture by the authorities.  He takes a bunch of MPH and ends up in the 1950s.

Roscoe and Rosa feeling guilty of all the stolen money they have give all of it away, instead of the meagre 10% from before.  Chevy, having built up resentment towards Roscoe for doing things without asking him, picks a fight with Roscoe and Rosa.  In the midst of the fight, Chevy tells Roscoe that he was the one that sold him out, not Sal. He was the one that wanted Rosa and he was the one that wanted better jobs from Sal.  The 1985 man and federal authorities show up and the 1985 man says the cop should fire at Chevy who goads them into shooting him, saying that he'll dodge it.  The cop fires.  Roscoe takes a bunch of MPH and charges Chevy, eventually placing him in front of the bullet.  The bullet kills Chevy.  Due to taking so many MPH pills, Roscoe ends up in 1985 and crashes into a building.  It's revealed that the man from 1985 is Roscoe but with 30 years time served.  Roscoe and Rosa are let go since Roscoe has already served his time.

Old Roscoe and Rosa wait at a diner where they all agreed they would meet if anyone got separated.  Some men show up and they give a letter to Rosa that explains what happened to Baseball.  The men are from the company that Baseball started and they were to execute the effects of his will.  They also gave Roscoe the car he was pining for when he was in prison.

## Overall

It was a quick read.  The art was okay.  I probably wouldn't have read it had it not been available through the library though.
