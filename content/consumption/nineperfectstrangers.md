## Plot

The book starts from the perspective of a paramedic (Yao) of two paramedics reviving a business executive.  

Flash forward to ten years later, nine strangers enroll in a retreat/resort hoping to change themselves and/or enjoy some relaxation.  The partcipants are as follows: a family of three, a lawyer, a millionaire couple, a divorcee, a romance novelist and a former football star.  Shortly after arriving, the guests are forced into five days of silence.  In addition, all of them are required to drink smoothies multiple times a day.  Their bags were also searched and removed of contraband before being sent to their rooms.  This is inquired by one of the guests (the football star) shortly after the silence is invoked.  Activities ensue for five days in silence.

It is revealed that the owner of the resort/retreat is the business executive that was dying ten years ago.  She (Masha) is assisted by one of the paramedics that revived her (Yao) and her former personal assitant, Delilah.  Masha had an epiphany after almost dying and pivoted to starting the resort, enlisting the two from her previous life after having set up the resort.

On the fifth day, the silence is broken and the group has another smoothie.  Heather, from the family of three, questions Masha aloud if they were being drugged with the smoothies. Masha admits they are with LSD.  The group is outraged and legal threats ensue.  Regardless, the group commences with a guided therapy under the influence of the drugs.  Progress occurs in the participants' personal relationships.  They all fall asleep in the group room.  It is revealed that they are locked in the group room without warning on waking up.

Reading that things are going awry, Delilah, under the pretext of making tea for the long day ahead, leaves Masha and Yao.  She steals one of the guest's (Ben's) super car and makes her way to the airport to leave the country.  Yao, increasingly skeptical of Masha's actions, is drugged with a sedative by Masha.  Masha, becoming increasingly deranged and unhinged from sleep deprivation and taking LSD herself, instigates a game called 'Death Row/Death Sentence' on the participants via teleconferencing via the television in the group group.  The game requires the participants to argue their case before a judge (Masha) on why their client should live.  The participants have until dawn of the next day to prepare their arguments.  Trapped in the room, starved of food and increasingly fearing for their lives, the guests play along.

Before dawn, Masha starts the game. Some of the guests make their argument.  Before all of the arguments are made, Masha claims she's begun burning down the resort and will be returning to her previous corporate life due to the disappointment of the lack of progress in the personal growth of the guests.  The guests smell smoke and hear fire and prepare to insulate themselves from the smoke.

Yao wakes from the sedative and it is revealed that the sound of the flames are pre-recorded from a video that Masha prepared. He stops the video and comes to terms with the fact that Masha is unhinged and must be stopped.

Frances (the novelist) thinks about something Masha said "Nothing is forever" and tries the door to exit the room.  It opens.  It is revealed to the guests that the smell of smoke came from burning the contents of a bin.

Masha and Yao come down to greet the guests.  Yao, resigned to continuing the charade, directs the guests to a meal.  Heather confronts Masha.  Masha attacks Heather with a sharp letter opener mentioned earlier in the book.  Frances hits Masha in the head with a candle holder and she's knocked down.  Frances' masseuse from the beginning of the book returns with her partner who's a cop.  Masha is implied to be arrested.  The guests stay the night at the resort before leaving the next day.
