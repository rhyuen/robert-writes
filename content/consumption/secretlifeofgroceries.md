# The Secret Life of Groceries

Book I borrowed from the library.  Spoilers and probably inaccurate summaries and tidbits below.  The book is by [Benjamin Lorr](https://twitter.com/benjaminlorr?lang=en).

## About 

It's about what it takes to get food from wherever in nature food is sourced and delivered to your stomach.  

## An Outline (in no particular order )

- a graphic description of a chicken slaughter house
- the graphic description of a the cleaning of a fridge of seafood in a grocery store
- the founding of trader joes
- a story bringing a new food product to market (slawsa) and the bribes to food buyers to get your product onto the shelf.
- working at a seafood counter at a whole foods
- indentured slavery in Thailand in food commodity markets
- Working as a Truck Driver
- The history of the Grocery Store (I forgot about this until I looked at my notes)

## Things I thought were noteworthy

The grocery market industry is really lean.

Nabisco stands for 'National Biscuit Company'.

7-11 stands for the company's original start times (7 am to 11pm).

Corrugated cardboard was actually really important in the facilitation of the creation of the grocery store from the general store.  It was actually revolutionary when they actually let people handle the products before the purchase of them. In general stores, you weren't allowed to touch the product.

The ubiquity of the cardboard box also facilitated the creation of the brand.

Grocery stores don't actually make money selling groceries.  They make money off of their suppliers.

Truck driving isn't as lucrative as it used to be.  It has the image of being a solid middle class job, however, this was prior to deregulation in the 80s.  At present, drivers are strongly nudged into being owner-drivers, which involves the driver taking on large loans, which aren't immediately clear to the signer until they're well into their career.  There's also a really high turnover rate for truck drivers either in the 60-70% range or over 100%, I do not recall which.  

Shrimp used to be a luxury food in the 80s.  However, now it's plentiful and relatively cheap due to aquaculture and there's also indentured labour/slavery used in the supply chain for the production of shrimp and other fungible goods like chocolate.  'Certification' merely incurs more costs on suppliers and often (probably always) doesn't entail better conditions or pay for the people actually doing the work.

## Quotes

"then, as now, convenience stores are essentially a real estate game.  The best locations at the best rent determine the best profits in a business where everyone is selling essentially the same items.  And real estate has only one rule: the one with the biggest balance sheet wins."

"Commodity is a matter of perception.  Coffee can be Folfgers or it can be terroir: ..."
    One item can be fungible or you can be really particular about it.  And those particularlities about said product can make all the idfference.

"But what we've begun to see, what I certainly learned writing this book, is that we've undertaken a new project.  We decided that, caught between two awesome external forces--nature everlasting, and these new tools of our own creation--the one piece in the whole operation that was most malleable was us.  Our selves.  That we would happily trade away aspects of our lives--be it community or duty or eccentricity or care--for an ability to survive between them."
