The below is based on what I recall on what I read and perhaps furnished with some notes I took whilst reading.

I finished the book a few days ago.  The describes four rules that the author coins towards finding your 'dream job' / 'passion' / 'doing great work that you love'.  We find out very quickly that 'finding your dream job' is a lie.  The four rules as the author describes them are as follows:

1. Finding your passion is a lie, for most people.
2. Obtain Career Capital (valuable skills someone will pay for)
3. Retaining Autonomy with coveted Career Capital
4. Finding a Mission with your Career Capital

For most people finding your passion is a fool's errand.  There are outliers, however.  Finding your passion suggests that if you're not happy all the time while doing your job there's the implicit notion that you're missing out or something better is out there.  As a result, you may, impractically, leave your job to find said passion/'dream job' and/or never develop any skills that require extended practice and usage to develop.

In order to do good work that you can be proud of, you need marketable skills, which this book calls 'career capital'.  One must use deliberate practice to become the best one can be.  Doing the same thing with little variation isn't good enough.  One needs to be doing strenuous mental activitiy. It's like working out for your brain/skills instead of your physical body.

This is from my notes on the second part: 

> It's important to stretch your skills to their current limits and obtain feedback on how you're doing in order to accelerate growth.  It's not enough just to put in the time.  You'll plateau.  If you're not pushing the limits to what you're doing then you'll be surpassed by someone tha tis.

> one must also consider the skills market that one is competing in.  Is it only the one skill that matters in that particular domain (e.g. in entertainment, only content matters) or will a select combination of skills in a variety of different capacities suffice.

The book notes that it's more important how you do your work than what it is that you do.  The 'passion' comes with skill and dedication to your craft, not before.  The book also discusses a comparison between the 'craftsman' approach and the 'passion' approach.  

Also from my notes:

> The craftsman approach focuses on what you and your skills can offer the world whereas the passion approach/mindset is what can the world offer you.

As one becomes more well-stocked with marketable skills/career capital one can demand/negotiate for more autonomy and/or working conditions.  However, do not proceed forward without being well-stocked in capital as it could result in a bad experience.  

Finding a mission is another thing that requires career capital.  You also have to be working in a discipline where you can stand out and do things that of note (people will talk about your accomplishments).  You exploits should also likely be documented in a domain where network effects are possible.

From the notes:

> Needing buzz and people talking about your work is for the financial viability of the mission.  One needs the mission to sustain itself or it becomes a resource sink.

> There's also mention of why a lot of discoveries happen in close temporaral proximity.  It is suggested that this is the case due to discoverers / pioneers already being on the forefront of that niche of the discipline and that there were enough clues that they noticed, and others as well, that they all followed to logical ends.
