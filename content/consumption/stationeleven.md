## Episode 1

Jeevan sees the lead actor of a live play die of a heart attack on stage.  As he leaves, he sees a child actor, Kristen, waiting for their guardian to accompany her home.  However, both her minder and the actor that looked out for her, Arthur, the man who died, are not present.  Jeevan takes it upon himself to escort Kristen home.  On the train, Jeevan gets a call from his sister, Siya, who's a doctor at a local hospital.  Siya predicts that this flu is going to get really bad and that he has to head to Frank's, like they agreed in the event of an emergency.  Jeevan has a panic attack but he recovers.  Jeevan and Kirsten walk the rest of the way to her house.  They knock on the door but no one is there.  As she can't go inide, Kirsten accompanies Jeevan while he goes grocery shopping.  He spends 10000 on groceries.  He daisy links a series of shopping carts to get the food to Frank's apartment.  Seeing as it was unlikely that Kirsten would be able to get home, Jeevan lies and gets her to go with him to Frank's place.  Jeevan and Kirsten arrive at Frank's apartment.  He reluctantly lets them in.  Jeevan and Kirsten are seen leaving Frank's apartment after 80 days. Frank is not with them.  We see the dead security guard, who let Jeevan and Kirsten in earlier in the show, and everything is covered in snow.

## Episode 2

It's twenty years after the first episode and Kristen is an actress with a travelling group of actors. There's a flashback to year one of the pandemic where she meets a woman that starts the travelling troupe.  Kristen is no longer accompanied by Jeevan.  Kristen and Alex go swimming in a lake and encounter a bearded stranger.  Alex is welcoming and the stranger speaks to her privately.  Kristen is far more suspicious of the stranger.  Back in the future, Kristen performs Hamlet at a town on 'the wheel', a path around lake Michigan.  After the performance, Kristen sits with the bearded man by a fire, who claims that he has to join the troupe, otherwise people will go missing.  Kristen stabs him in the torso, leaving him to bleed out and die.  When she wakes and goes back to the site where she stabbed him, she finds that he's missing; however, a pool of dried blood remains.

## Episode 3

This episode is a flashback to Day One of the pandemic for Miranda, the person that wrote and illustrated 'Station Eleven'.

## Episode 4

Interspersed through the episode are flashbacks of Jeevan and Kristen living together in a cabin which is blanketed with snow.  Jeevan has hunted a number of wolves to eat.  At some point, Kristen wonders where Jeevan is.

The acting troupe goes to the country club home of one of the founders.  They learn that the Prophet was there and that he kidnapped/tricked four children to leave with him.  Alex is cast as the lead in Hamlet.  Kristen reveals to Alex that she stabbed the Prophet, which is why Alex could not leave with the Prophet as she had planned.  Alex leaves the Country Club on horseback.  At the end of the episode, two of them return to the country club with mines strapped to their chests.  They both go off when they hug the founder, while Kristen tries to stop one of them.

## Episode 5 (February 10, 2022)

The audience finds out that the 'Prophet' is Arthur's son, Tyler.  The reason he has a copy of the 'Station Eleven' graphic novel from Miranda is she gave a special copy to Arthur for his son.  In this episode we flashback to Clark, Arthur's best friend, and how he went into the pandemic.  He gets stranded in Severn City Airport with a lot of other passengers, including Elizabeth, Arthur's ex-wife and Tyler.  As the gravity of the pandemic sets in, Clark sets up and leads the passengers into forming a community at the airport, after Jerry, a janitor posing as a DHS officer, absconds to Florida with a pilot and most of the female soccer team.  Before this happens, we see that a plane full of infected is left to die on the tarmac.  On Day 12, Tyler sees a survivor of the flu leaving the plane.  It's assumed he's assume.  One of the leading passengers, not wanting to take any risks, shoots the supposed survivor dead.  Elizabeth goes to comfort Tyler and both are exiled into quarantee on a private plane for 30 days.  During quarantine, Tyler retreats more into his 'Station Eleven' book.  Tyler sets the plane, that the infected were locked in, on fire.  Elizabeth and Clark run to save him, assuming he's inside. He's presumed dead and the episode ends with Tyler walking away from the airport and a montage of sorts where he becomes 'the prophet'.

## Episode 6 (February 11, 2022)

The founder is dead from the mines going off.  Alex didn't go find the Prophet.  She stayed with Teresa, the founder's wife.  The Prophet and the Undersea burnt down the gas station that the Orchestra and the Actors were going to meet at.  They left tombstones of all the Acting Troupe members there as a warning of what will happen.  Kirsten, seeing this before the rest of the troupe, goes looking for the Prophet to finish killing him.  The troupe arrives shortly after.  The man from the Museum of Civilization tenders the invitation for them again.  In a torrent of rain and with the Orchestra already there, Sarah, the other founder, accepts the invitation.  They leave without Kirsten, figuring that she'll find them on her own.  Kirsten follows a trail to a body of water, where she is surrounded by Undersea.  They bring her to the Founder.  She delays killing him in exchange for him leading her to the Museum of the Civilization, who've invited the Acting Troupe to do a performance for them.

The Troupe arrives at the Museum of Civilization, which seems to be the Severn City Airport from episode five.  The Orchestra is, in fact, there.  Shortly after reuniting with the Orchestra, Sarah has a medical issue.  The audience is led to believe that she might've died.

The Undersea and Kirsten are ambushed by Red Bandanas.  One of the older ones is killed.  Kirsten pushes the Prophet off an elevation to keep him from getting shot.  The episode ends with Kirsten surrounded by three Red Bandanas.

## Episode 7 (February 12, 2022)

In the skirmish with the Red Bandanas, Kirsten was hit with poisoned darts.  She hallucinates.  Throughout the episode, a black substance, the poison, is seen slowy inching towards her torso.  The audience sees what happens during the eighty days that Jeevan, Frank and Kirsten sheltered in Frank's apartment.

We learn that Frank has/had a heroin addiction.  We also learn that he's a ghostwriter, who can't write unless he uses heroin.  Over the course of the sheltering period, Jeevan begins to speak to himself.  For instance, he speaks to Siya, who has likely died from the flu.  The trio stay in the apartment longer than planned.  Jeevan states that Siya's plan was to have them leave around day 60, with a food supply for 90 days.  They stay longer, ultimately staying to 80 days.  Frank and Kirsten want to stay longer to finish their work: his biography and a play rendition of Station Eleven, respectively.  Frank his relucant to venture into the outside world.  Jeevan breaks the barricaded front door and explores the apartment complex before the day they leave.  The trio perform the Station Eleven play.  During the play, a survivor, wanting the apartment for himself, breaks in and threatens their lives with a knife if they don't leave the apartment.  Jeevan agrees to leave as he was going to anyways.  Frank refuses and is stabbed.  Jeevan and the intruder enter a scuffle and Jeevan beats him to death.  

Frank, bleeding out, requests to be placed in his bed.  He dies in it.  Kirsten keeps the knife that killed Frank.  The pair leave.
