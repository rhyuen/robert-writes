# Think Again by Adam Grant

## When I'm Writing this

Shortly after reading it, so May 16, 2021.  I opted not to take notes whilst reading (I caved at the last chapter because of the quotes) to test how much I could remember from the book and tried to remember the key ideas throughout the week so I wouldn't forget too much.

## About

The book covers the utility of rethinking previously considered ideas that may not longer serve their holder.  I finished it in around two weeks.  It's not a particularly long book.  Unfortunately, the footnotes denoted by an asterisk are located at the end of the ebook and not nearby the asterisk and I couldn't be bothered to flip back and forth so I read them at the end.

## Some things that I recall about the book

The book covers the following:

- Dunning-Kruger effect
- Emotional and Cognitive Conflict.  The latter for more productive conversations.
- Motivational Interviews for confront deep seated ideas.
- Negotiation / Argument as a 'Dance' as opposed to a Conflict.
- Psychological Safety with respect to NASA launches

The book opens with the firefighting in forest fires and devising the escape fire.  As a group of forest fire fighters engage in fighting a fire, the situation changes suddenly and fleeing becomes the most pragmatic option.  As they flee, one of the firefighters begins setting things on fire around him to the befuddlement of his fellow teammates.  In the end, post-fire, only three survive the ordeal, two via running and the third was the one setting off small fires around him.  What he was doing was he was burning plant matter around him so that when the wildfire reached him there would be nothing left to burn whilst he huddled to the ground and waited for the fire to blow over.  This was not taught nor trained.  He devised it in the midst of the crisis, unbeknownst to his cohorts.  The rest of the book uses this example as a jumping off point and posits the question of when should one rethink things and why?

Higher intelligence people tend to have a harder time rethinking or being stuck in their ways.  This was mentioned with how Blackberry/RIM failed to reinvent itself and were stuck resting on their laurels when the iPhone launched and within a few years relegated their products to 1% marketshare or something that was a farcry from its prime.

Forecasters (that's not what they're called in the book, they're people that predict events with degrees of probability in the future and it turns out there's a competitiion for it) tend to rethink things 2 to 4 times or something to that effect.

Motivational Interviews (I remember, or at least I think do, the name because it sounds like 'Motivational Speaking') can get people to change deep-seated entrenched opinions because the techniques used involve deep listening to the other party and remove the air of condescension which often puts people with deep-seated, likely unpopular opinions on the defensive.  I think they often involve asking the other party 'how' they would put their ideas into reality, which prompts a sort of deeper thinking and that slowly chips away at the potential fallacies/flaws the deep seated idea may contain.

On 'Negotiation/Argument as a Dance as opposed to war', it's often better to concede some points to the other party to demonstrate that the two or more parties have some degree of common ground and then all of you can focus on deliberating on the differing points.  When presenting your argument, it's more effective in demonstrating data/evidence/support when you present a few strong points as opposed to as many points as possible, regarding of their strenght.  Your weaker points can be more easily picked apart and will lead to the stronger ones being undercut.

## Some selected passages that I thought were particularly thought-provoking/interesting/wise

"Our happiness often depends more on what we do than where we are.  It's our actions--not our surroudnings--that bring us meaning and belonging."  

"Interest doesn't always lead to effort and skill; sometimes it follows them."  

This echoes a sentiment similar to something I read in "So Good They Can't Ignore You"

"...if this job didn't exist, how much worse off would people be?"
I like this one because it compels you to think of why you're doing what you're doing.
