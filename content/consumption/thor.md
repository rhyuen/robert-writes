## Summary

The Black Winter which ends universes is coming.  This is revealed by Galactus after he crash lands in Asgard seeking Thor's help.  Galactus says he's the only one who can stop the Black Winter.  Thor convenes a meeting of all the prior heralds of Galactus in Asgard.  The Silver Surfer reveals that there are five planets that Galactus can consume to increase his already sizeable powers.  Galactus is surprised that the Surfer hid such information from him despite being the surfer's former master.  Thor leads him to all of the planets after Galactus grants him the power cosmic.

Thor leads Galactus to the first planet, but makes him wait for the evacuation to finish before he lets Galactus eat.  All of the inhabitants are evacuated to Asgard.  Beta Ray Bill shows up and seeks vengeance on Galactus for eating the planet.  Bill and Thor fight and Bill loses.  The new guardian of the Bifrost, Sif, intervenes and gives sanctuary to Bill on Asgard, saving his life.  However, Bill has lost hammer in the fight.

Thor leads Galactus to the remaining planets. They get to the last planet, which is populated.  However, the Black Winter has arrived and they are out of time.  No time for evacuations.  Galactus promptly eats the planet, inhabitants and all.  Galactus and Thor agree that there will be conflict between the two after dealing with the Black Winter.  

We learn from the Black Winter that it is not here to destory the universe.  It is here to take Galactus as a herald as was agreed upon when Galactus took the offer to be the only survivor of his home universe.  Galactus, however, fled and didn't hold up his end of the agreement.  Thor, angered at having been manipulated by Galactus, takes the power cosmic from him and kills him.  The Black Winter, pleased at being assisted by Thor, thanks him.  However, Thor says that the Black Winter will not be taking Galactus.  Instead, Thor kills him as well.  Upon dying, the Black Winter asks Thor if he wants to know how he dies.  Thor says 'yes'.  When Thor returns home and the Surfer asks him what happened when the Black Winter responsed to your 'yes', Thor lies and says 'darkness'.  Instead, the audience gets an image of Thanos with Mjolnir, all the Infinity Stones and a world with Zombie Avengers.

## Thoughts

The art was quite good and the ending was unexpected.
