## About

Finished on February 10, 2022.  Written by Donny Cates and drawn by Nic Klein.  Spoilers follow in the Summary below.

## Summary

Thor's hammer is becoming increasingly difficult for Thor to lift. However, it's becoming easier for unworthy people to lift.

Thor is having difficulty being the All-Father and he wants a break.  He opts to use Donald Blake to take his place back in the mortal realm and he wants to Loki to look after Blake whilst Thor is away.  Blake and Thor swap.  However, Blake is no longer as he was.

Blake, now insane and hell-bent on vengeance against Odin for trapping him in the dream world without changing his perception of time and finding out that his entire life was a lie, attacks Loki.  Thor, walking in Blake's fictional world discovers all the inhabitants dead and Blake having written questions in the inhabitants' blood, things like "This is Hell".  Thor finds a dying Midgard Serpent slain by Blake, who tells Thor that Blake has stolen his power.

Blake after attacking Loki and stealing Jarnborn, steals the enchantments placed on Beta Ray Bill by Odin, changing Bill in appearance.  Blake attacks Sif and steals the sword that controls the Bifrost.  With the blade, he sends Asgard into hell.  

Blake visits Jane Foster and learns that she became Thor.  Incensed but not wanting to kill her in his quest to kill all Thors, he leaves.  Blake targets Phrog next.  However, Phrog dispatchs him and takes him to Doctor Strange.  While at the Sanctum Santorum, Blake overtakes both Strange and Phrog.  When stealing the Odin Enchantments from Strange, Blake learns, from Strange's memory of him fighting Loki to be Sorceror Supreme, that he can get access to the Odinforce from the tree Yggdrissil.  Blake heads to Yggdrissil and proceeds chopping the tree, its blood dripping into the world that Thor is trapped in.

Foster, having seen Blake assault Phrog and Strange, journies to an unnamed realm where Odin is found drunk in a pub. She rallies him to rectify his mistake and go to Yggdrissil.  All our previously assaulted heroes gather to the tree to stop Blake.  With his power increasing from the blood of Yggdrissil, Thor calls his crows to pull his soul and embed it in the Destroyer encountered earlier when Blake was stealing Jarnborn.  

Odin arrives and hits Blake and he drops Jarnborn off the Rainbow Bridge of the Bifrost.  He calls Mjolnir to himself, but Beta Ray Bill catches it and his Odin Enchantments and previous appearance are restored.  The Destroyer appears and hits Blake.  Loki throws the cane that's used to transform Blake into Thor and the destroyer catches it.  Thor in his physical form appears after the Destroyer opens itself up.  

Thor doesn't kill Blake but strikes him with large bolts of lightning.  He sends Odin on his out of Asgard and Loki volunteers to dole out a punishment for Blake.  The volume ends with Blake bound on a table with an enormous stake dripping yellow venom onto his face.  As this happens, Loki says that he's giving Blake his old title and throne of 'God of Lies' and Blake's wish of a real life and godhood.

## Thoughts

The art was quite good, but inconsistent, and the ending was unexpected.
