# Plot

Following from Book 7, Persepolis Rising, Laconia has won and has become the seat of the human empire.  The Transport Union, Earth and Mars have all submitted to Laconian rule.

Holden is captured and, treated in his words, as a 'dancing bear'.  He's trotted out as a piece for Winston Duarte to demonstrate his power and suggesting that even the hero of the solar system is a trifle to him.

Avarasala dies prior to the book beginning with Holden attending the funeral.  She's interred on Laconia for politcal reasons.

Teresa Duarte realizes she's in a golden cage after her father is incapacitated by the alien species retaliation to the anti-matter ship/bomb being sent to wherever the gates go when they go 'flying dutchman'.  The prisoner's dilemma is used as both a teaching tool for Teresa and as a way of Winston Duarte to determine whether the gates going 'dutchman' is as a result of natural causes or whether they're controlled by a sentient entity.  

Bobby and Alex end up unknowingly steal anti-matter from a resupply ship whilst trying to capture a Laconian political officer, who is killed in the attempt.  They use the anti-matter as a bomg against the 'tempest' laconian flagship, in an attempt both to reduce the protomolecule laconian flagships from two to one, with the first one having been destroyed, along with Medina Station by the 'dutchman race' as retaliation for the aforementioned anti-matter ship/bomb that Duarte used. Bobby succeeds in destroying the tempest, but dies in the attempt.

Amos was sent to Laconia prior to the book starting and has been presumed dead due to not having been in contact with the resistance for an extended period of time.  He was sent to destroy the Laconian leadership or to rescue Holden.  Probably both since they sent him with a pocket nuke.

Amos stumbles upon Teresa and they become friends.  She sneaks out of the secure residences and visits her friend 'Timothy', which is what she calls Amos.  On a visit after Winston Duarte's mind impairment, Teresa sneaks out to visit Timothy.  She is retrieved by her teacher/handler, "Ilich", who shoots and kills Amos.  He reveals that Amos is an insurgent to a distraught Teresa.  Amos comes back to life after having been repaired by the native Laconian repair bots left behind by the people that made the protomolecule.  He reenters the story when Teresa breaks Holden out of prison to use as barter for travel when she decides Laconia no longer has anything left for her after her father is incapacitated.  He kills his killer, Illich, who was in pursuit of Holden and Teresa on their path to the Rocinante.

Holden plays a minor role in the book.  He plants the idea of using Teresa as a potential subject for experimentation with the protomolecule to Corazar, former Protogen Scientist with the appropriate deficit in morals and who is also the head of science on Laconia.  This is a ploy to get Corazar killed and replaced by Elvi, unbeknownst to her.  Corazar is killed by the incapacitated Winston Duarte after Teresa, who thought her father was mentally gone but physically present, tells her father that Corazar is designs to kill her.

Elvi as a scientist hand-picked by Winston Duarte, due to Holden's suggestion, to discover ways of destroying the aliens finds a planet sized diamond that she hypothesizes may hold all of the protomolecule creators' civilization's  knowledge.  She also discovers a system with a neutron star that's just on the cusp of being a black hole.  Upon discovery, this is when the previously mentioned anti-matter ship is used and the aliens retaliate by putting a bit of matter in the system with the huge neutron star which tips the system over and turns it into a black hole, which resulted in a massive amount of energy being released.  This ends up going through the deliberately positioned gate and wiping out Medina station and the "Eye of the Typhoon" Magnatar-class ship.  Elvi's ship returns to Laconia after the ship having been fileted by the aliens.  There are literal holes in the ship and its occupants.  The military officer in charge of the ship has a tranche of his head removed.  

Naomi becomes the head of the resistance after Medina is wiped out.  Saba was the head prior to her but she took it up after he died on Medina.  Naomi captains the Rocinante after Bobby dies and Alex rejoins her.  She comes up with a plan to takeout the protomolecule creator platforms that helps the Laconians make anti matter and the magnatar class ships.  She identifies those as key targets and rallies all of the resistance to attack the Laconia in a weeks long siege on the planet and its lone remaining Magnatar class ship.  It's done.  During the siege of the platforms, they receive a pickup call from Amos' receiver, which was triggered by Teresa and Holden, as Teresa was jailbreaking Holden.  Holden, Teresa and Amos (now all grey with black eyes and no sclera, it seems) are all retrieved by the Rocinante.
