## Summary

## Volume 1

Brock thinks there's something wrong with Venom.  Regardless, Brock carries on with life.  One day, whilst trying to apprehend the Jack O'Lantern, he loses control and starts killing him.  He's thwarted by a man that creates a distraction and helps spirit him away before he kills the pursuing cops.  

The man that helped him escape is Rex Strickland and he reveals that the US Government has been using symbiotes since the Vietnam War and Rex and his buddies were amongst the first.  Strickland wants Venom to break his insane platoon mates out of a transport.  He does so.  However, during the breakout, Brock encounters another party that absorbs the symbiotes from the captive symbiotes and their hosts.

Turns out, the unknown party is the Grendel which is dragon that has a symbiote of its own.  Venom pursues it.  Whilst there, Venom encounters Miles Morales.  After a brief scuffle, they work together to stop the Grendel.  Unfortunately, Miles gets swallowed by the Grendel whilst attempting to deliver a Venom Blast to incapacitate it.  Miles succeeds.  After the Grendel falls, Knull presents Miles to Brock. Knull, an avatar of him, explains to Brock that he is the god of all symbiotes and that the symbiotes are hiding that their planet is not a planet but a cage of symbiotes devoted to sealing away Knull.  Klyntar actually means 'cage'.  Knull created all symbiotes but lost control of them when Thor dispatched the Grendel with lightning thousands of years ago.  After Knull lost control, the other symbiotes banded together to seal him away and he's been sealed away since.  

Knull absorbs the Venom symbiote and connects it back into the hive mind.  Before the Knull Avatar/Grendel leaves, Miles uses a Venom Blast on Knull which displaces the connect Venom symbiote from Knull.  Venom bonds back with Brock.  Miles punctures the body of Knull/Grendel and both Miles and Brock fall from the sky.  Grendel was flying towards space.

Unable to get Miles to make a web parachute, Venom grows wings and flies them safely to the ground.  Venom explains to Brock that with the brief connection to Knull he learned a lot and is now able to do more things as a result.  Venom returns to Strickland.  It is revealed after Venom punctures Strickland's head that Strickland is in fact a symbiote that came from Grendel and Grendel is currently looking for Strickland before he can return to Knull.  Brock absorbs Strickland, at his request, and adds his power to his own.

Brock and Strickland do combat with Grendel/Knull.  Ultimately, Strickland detaches from Venom and traps Grendel and itself in a furnace and they both die in there together, with Brock/Venom sealing the hatch of the furnace and incurring severe burns in the process.  The volume ends with Brock passed out and Venom seemingly leaving him behind.

## Volume 2

Venom/Brock is held under capitivity by the Maker.  Brock was captured in front of his father's house.  However, Brock was not aware of acting four days from the end of the last volume to his capture by the Maker.  According to the Maker, Venom, the symbiote, is brain-dead.  Brock is a suspect in the stealing of a sample of the Grendel symbiote from the Maker.  Brock breaks out of captivity.  He goes back to his father's house to find out what he was doing there.  In addition, he asks about his sister, but the father says he had no sister. His father shoos him away and calls the cops.  While there, Brock discovers he has a step-brother, Dylan.  

Dylan, with visible bruises, later seeks him out, wanting him to kill their father, the one responsible for the bruises. They share a meal together and talk.  In an alley, Brock has an episode an unknowingly attacks his brother.  Brock then falls ill and Dylan brings Brock to the hospital.  Brock and Dylan are picked up once again by the Maker.

The Maker reveals to Dylan that Brock has a severe case of cancer.  The Maker puts Brock undertreatment.  Whilst under treatment, Brock learns that he never had a sister and that he never had an uncle that died of cancer.  These were all false memories planted by the Venom symbiote to prevent Brock from leaving it.  Brock questions why Venom thinks he would leave them when they've been together for so long and overcome so much.  Venom reveals it's because of Dylan and who he is.  Dylan is not Brock's step-brother but his son.

Brock escapes from the Maker and finds his father.  He does a symbiote thing where the two talk with their minds.  Brock threatens his father to leave Dylan alone or he'll kill him.  The audience also learns that, as a young adult, Brock drove drunk and killed a child.  After Brock was arrested, he wanted to plead guilty.  However, his father beat him in the interrogation room until he said he would plead innocent.  Using his influence and wealth, his father made it such that Brock suffered no drawbacks or consequences from his mistake.

Dylan and Brock reunite, with the Venom symbiote dropping Dylan off with Brock.  The Venom symbiote decides that the two Brocks are better off without the symbiote and leaves.

## Venom: War of the Realms

With the invasion of the Earth underway by the Dark Elves and their alliance across the nine realms, Brock and Dylan head for shelter.  After finding shelter, Brock helps a group of people being assaulted  by Dark Elves.  He engages them, sans symbiote, and is gravely wounded.  A witch, seeking entertainment and a new enforcer for the Dark Elves, offers him a Dreamstone which would grant him any weapon he desires.  Brock, desperate for a weapon, wishes for a symbiote.  And, just like that, he's Venom again.  However, there's no voice that speaks to him anymore.  It's just him.  Venom dispatches the attackers.  When the witch presents the strings attached to the dreamstone, Brock bites her arm off.

The witch, unhappy with how her gambit played out, finds the Jack O Lantern and empowers him with a dreamstone.  Jack O Lantern seeks vengeance for how he was humiliated by Brock in Volume 1.  He begins setting fire to the city with his new Dreamstone powers in an attempt to lure him out.  Brock responds.  The two do combat. Brock realizes that the Dreamstones work based on imagination.  He overcomes Jack O Lantern by changing the dreamstone from a power for himself to empowering the terrified citizens he's trying to save.  Jack O Lantern is dispatched.  I think Jack's Dreamstone is destroyed or Brock takes it.  I'm not entirely sure.

## Volume 3

Absolute Carnage Tie-in.  There's a page or two explaining how Brock got his symbiote back via the Dreamstone.  But, in the volume, the symbiote talks to him.  As such, I'm not really sure how this all works out canonically.  I guess the reader is just supposed to assume the venom symbiote came back and undid the events of the end of Volume 2.  

Normie and Dylan stay at the warehouse where the Maker is working on the device that safely removes symbiote codices from former hosts without killing them.  Knull/Carnage serving symbiotes and hosts arrive and attack the area.  The Maker stops them; however, at some point, the Maker is infested with the symbiotes.

Sleeper, Venom's seventh child, arrives.  His host is a dead Kree person.  He attempts to bond with Dylan but Dylan's body rejects him.  Instead, Dylan wields him in the form of a wolf/dog when the Carnage symbiote hosts attack.  Later, Sleeper takes the form a cat, which is more to Dylan's liking.  At some point, the audience learns that symbiotes spawn offspring when cataclysmic world events happen and I think, the Maker, denotes a timeline of each of the Venom Symbiote's offspring and their precipitating cataclysmic event.

Carnage threatens Brock and makes him decide on whether to kill him and his son to prevent the release Knull from Klyntar or save his son and release Knull.  Brock opts to save his Son.  Somehow, Brock ends up infested with Carnage as well.  I don't recall the events.  Knull goes free.  It's revealed to Dylan that Brock is his father and not his step-brother.

We learn that the maker is working in a cabal with Reed Richards' from other dimensions.  The Maker is looking to restore his Universe 1610 that was destroyed in Secret Wars 01.  To successfully traverse to other dimensions, he somehow has his hands on a synthetic symbiote from his home dimension which he can wear and it'll protect him physically and mentally.

## Volume 4 (Feb 18, 2022)

Brock is invited to Avengers Mountain by Captain America to entertain the idea of potentially joining the Avengers after he stopped Carnage.  Brock asks to think about it, after being taunted in his mind by the Carnage symbiote he's still fused with.  Not wanting to endanger his son, Brock heads to the island where he attempted to kill Spider-man in the past.  There, he plans to separate the Carnage symbiote from himself and from the Venom symbiote.  On the island, Brock separates from both symbiotes.  However, the Carnage symbiote manages to bind with him without the Venom symbiote.  The Carnage symbiote torments Brock in his mind.  Dylan, having kept a portion of the Grendel/Knull symbiote, unable to bond with it, uses it as a means of connecting to the Klyntar hive mind.  He finds the Venom symbiote.  Dylan, using an ability that only Knull has, remote controls the Venom symbiote and transforms into a T-Rex to do battle with Carnage/Brock.  dylan/venom loses but I think Thor arrives and somehow splits Brock/Carnage.  I think Brock preplanned the arrival of Thor since Thor defeated Knull in the past.  Brock heads back to Avengers Mountain.  He informs them that Knull is coming. Dylan also reveals to Brock that he has powers of some sort.  Most of Carnage is dead, but the audience sees a bit of it in the water near the island.
