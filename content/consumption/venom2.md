## Volume 5 (February 20, 2022)

Brock and Dylan visit the Maker to see what is the nature of Dylan's symbiote powers.  The Maker bounds with the synthetic symbiote from his home universe.  The dimensional portal he built is complete.  Virus, an attacker that claims Brock 'ruined his life', attacks Brock.  The Maker, Virus, Brock and Dylan all tumble into the dimensional portal ending up in different universes.  The Maker ends up in his former 1610 universe and the others end up in a universe when every human has a symbiote, ruled over by a character called Codex.

Virus and Brock continue their scuffle from the previous dimension until the symbiote Avengers of the universe show up to apprehend Brock for not being connected to the Hive Mind.  Virus is captured and brought to Codex.  Brock and Dylan escape to the sewers, where they meet a resistance of non-Hive Mind symbiote and host pairs.  They're led by the current universe's Venom, Annie Brock.  It's revealed that in this universe, Brock successfully killed himself in the church where he would've bonded with the Venom symbiote. Instead, Annie ends up bonding with the Venom symbiote.  It's revealed that Codex is an adult Dylan who has been heavily influenced by Knull.

...I don't remember what happens here (March 15/22)...

After everything is resolved with Codex, Richards takes a year to fix the dimension hopping machine.  Brock and Dylan return home.  Knull has arrived.

## Volume 6 and King in Black

The two volumes happen together, with the former from Brock's Point of View.  Volume 6 informs as to why and how things happen in King in Black.  Volume 6 also has the epilogue to King in Black, which kind of ends abruptly.

Knull is here.  The measures put in place by the Avengers to stop Knull don't even slow his army down.
Brock confronts Knull and is thrown from a tower after Knull steals the Venom symbiote from him.  It turns out Brock/Venom is not who Knull seeks.  It's Dylan he is after.  A lot of Marvel heroes are infested with symbiotes and taken control of.

Brock is saved and recovered by Spider-Man and sent underground to recooperate.  Eventually, Brock dies.  The remaining uninfested heroes and Dylan confront Knull.  Dylan is captured by Knull.  In a weird mind prison thing that Dylan is connected to Knull in, Dylan somehow forces Knull to release the heroes that are bound to symbiotes.

Whilst Dylan and the heroes are doing what they're doing against null, Brock's mind, as a codex, is in the symbiote hive mind and traversing around.  He finds the minds/codices of Rex and Flash Thompson.
