## A Summary of Events of Season 2 of the Witcher

__Spoilers are in the summaries.__

### Episode 1 (12/19/21)

Geralt and Ciri stay with a friend of Geralt's for the night after coming across a desolate town which was formerly constantly busy.  Geralt's friend is cursed to look like boar because he desecrated a temple and attacked a priestess whilst intoxicated; however, the audience doesn't find out the assaulting of the priestess until the end of the episode.

### Episode 2 (12/19/21)

Geralt and Ciri return to the home of the Witchers of which there are only a handful left.  The location of the Witcher home is now a closely held secret due to a previous attack that exterminated all but one of the adult witchers, Vesemir.  Vesemir, as a result, was obligated to take care of all the young, not-yet, witchers that had survived the attack.  Ciri meets the other witchers.  Eskel, a witcher, returns home injured.  Eskel later invites over company to celebrate everyone's relatively safe return.  When Eskel secrets away with one of the guests, he begins to transform into a tree monster, after being wounded and infected by a tree monster.  Vesemir and Geralt engage the infected Eskel and kill him. Geralt begins training Ciri so that she can defend herself.

### Episode 3

Yennifer returns to the mage citadel.  However, we find that she is unable to use magic and she is suspected of being a spy for the opposition because she came back alive. The black knight that was captured is sentenced to be executed by Yennifer to demonstrate that she is not a spy.  She causes a distraction and flees with the black knight.

Ciri is mocked by the other witchers and goaded into attempting a difficult obstacle course.  After numerous failed attempts she almost completes the course and wins the encouragement and respect of the other witchers.  She almost completes the course as Geralt watches on but ultimately fails.  

Vesemir and Geralt leave Eskel's corpse for wolves to eat after having dissected him.  After Ciri's obstacle course failed attempt, She and Geralt are attacked by the Leshy that infected Eskel.  The leshy is killed by the wolves that ate Eskel's infected corpse, having been infected themselves.  Ultimately, Geralt kills the infected wolf monster.

### Episode 4

Triss appears at Geralt's request to train Ciri in controlling Chaos.  Ciri reveals that she destroyed a monolith during the first season.  Cahir and Yennefer seek passage to Cintra.  Jaskier reappears as the Sandpiper helping smuggle elves to Cintra.  Jaskier and Yennefer reunite.  Cahir boards the boat for Cintra.  Jaskier's lute is ominously destroyed at the end of the episode.  Geralt appears before Istredder with the help of Triss to inquire as to how a monolith may be destroyed.

### Episode 5

Yennefer stays behind to look for Jaskier.  He's held hostage and tortured by a fire mage who wants information on Geralt/Ciri.  Yennefer finds him and spits alcohol in the fire mage's face when he had an open flame in front of his face, scarring him prominently.  They escape.  Yennefer learns from the witch that what she needs to restore her magic is Ciri. Vesemir learns that Ciri is of Elder blood after he finds flowers blooming where Ciri has bled.  No witchers have been able to be created since the last attack on Kaer Morhen due to the absence of the crucial ingredient.  With Triss' help and Ciri's blood, Vesemir is able to recreate the serum used to make witchers.  Ciri attempts to become a Witcher, but is interrupted by Geralt, having returned from his journey to the broken monolith with Istredd, before they can begin the process.  Cahir (the black knight) arrives in Cintra.

### Episode 6 (01/08/22)

Cahir's presence in Cintra undermines Fringilla's authority.  Francesca's daughter is born.

Geralt brings Ciri to a temple where Witchers, amongst others, were trained.  Yennefer appears at the temple as well, seeking Ciri.  Yennefer and Geralt reunite.  The Fire Mage attacks the temple, seek Ciri.  Yennefer leaves with Ciri to the witch's cabin.

### Episode 7

Yennefer brings Ciri to the entrance to the Witch's cabin.  The witch is actually a parasite the witchers imprisoned in a cabin a long time ago. Its name is the deathless mother and it's revealed that it's actually from another dimension.  Ultimately, it's released from its confines when Francesca's child is killed and when Fringilla kills the Elf discrimating military in Xintrea.  Fringilla leaves Cahir alive so that he can talk her up to the White Flame about how she is an effective leader.  Once the Deathless Mother is released, it inhabits Ciri.

### Episode 8 (01/14/22)

Francesca believes that Reidania is responsible for her child's death, so she goes to Redania and uses a spell to kill all of the children in Reidania.  

Whilst inhabiting Ciri's body, the Deathless Mother kills a number of Witchers at Kaer Morhen and summons Basilisks via portals.  Ciri's mind is occupied in an illusion where her parents, Mousesack and her grandmother are still alive and she resumes being a princess.  Ultimately, she is broken out of the illusion by Geralt and Yennefer slitting her wrists and allowing the Deathless Mother to take her as its host instead.  The three of them end up transported to the Deathless Mother's home dimension where it flies off of Yennefer.  The three of them see the riders of the Wild Hunt before Ciri portals them back to their home dimension.  The three of time plan to leave Kaer Morhen as they believe that people will come looking for Ciri again.

The brotherhood of mages commit themselves to killing Ciri once they find out she is alive.  The white flame arrives at Xintrea where Fringella, supported by Cahir, takes credit for ordering the execution of the Elf baby.  The white flame announces that he cannot trust the two of them because it was he who actually ordered the baby's execution.  It is then revealed that the white flame is Ciri's father and he reveals to Fringilla and those present in the room that Ciri is his daughter, who he intends to get back.
