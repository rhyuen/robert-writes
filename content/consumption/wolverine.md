## About

Finished on June 18, 2022.  Spoilers follow in the Summary below.

## Summary

With the arrival of Krakoa, Russia has started its own organization that disrupts Krakoa's pharmaceutical business in the form of an organizaton named "The Flower Cartel".  That organization employs the use of a mutant telepath called "The Pale Girl".  The Pale Girl steals the flowers uniquely grown by Krakoa by mind controlling the crew of the Marauder to forfeit its cargo of petals to the Flower Cartel.  The Cartel uses the loot to create a drug called Pollen, which is occasionally laced with poison and disseminated into the populace.  After having been tricked into killing his X-Force teammates, Wolverine gets Magneto drunk and borrows his helmet.  Wolverine hatches a scheme with a CIA contractor, who has a daughter that is in dire need of one of the backordered drugs that Krakoa makes, and sneaks the X-Force team into the headquarters of the Flower Cartel.  X-Force dispatches the Flower Cartel and the Pale Girl.

Omega Red seeks citizenship in Krakoa.  Wolverine is suspicious of Omega Red's motives.  Upon questioning Omega Red, Wolverine is prompted by Red to investigate Paris as to why Red came to Krakoa under suspicious circumstances (leaving behind a trashed car filled with a trunk of corpses).  Wolverine goes to Paris and is accosted by Vampires, who abscond with some of his blood after taking one of his allies, a Nightguard - vampire hunters, hostage.  The vampires use the blood and give it to their leader, Dracula, who uses it to enable him to operate in the day.  It is revealed to the reader that Red worked with Dracula, who wanted Wolverine delivered to him, in order to get a device which enables him to sate his hunger.

Wolverine travels to a bar in Northern Canada to get away from the surveillance state of Krakoa.  The humans at the bar recognize Wolverine.  They somehow restrain him and plan to freeze him in the water below.  Omega Red and a horde of vampires arrive and kill the humans restraining Wolverine.  Wolverine is frozen in the water below anyways.  Whilst frozen, Wolverine is drained of his blood to ensure that more vampires can work during the day.  A group of young vampires who avoid killing humans for food free Wolverine.  The group proceed to a town that they know is being targeted by the vampires.  They dispatch the vampires.  Only one of the group of young vampires survives (of three).  

## Thoughts

The art was consistent and fine.  It was partially about vampires, wasn't thrilled about that.
