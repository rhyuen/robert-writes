## About

Finished on June 20, 2022.  Spoilers follow in the Summary below.

## Summary

Maverick, a mutant that Wolverine used to work with, is missing. Wolverine finds that he has been brainwashed and is being auctioned off in Madripoor.  During the auction, Wolverine says a keyword that enables Maverick to break out of the brainwash that the pair established during their mercenary days.  Together, they escape Madripoor and return to Maverick's submarine that is his base of operations.  Wolverine offers Maverick citizenship to Krakoa but he declines.  

The nightguard Wolverine met in the first volume has been turned into a vampire.  During the last meeting of the Nightguard, Louise (the nightguard) and the other nightguards were betrayed by one of their own.  The group was ambushed by vampires and turned into them.  Omega Red tells Wolverine that what the vampires want is Wolverine's blood.  With Beast's help, Omega Red brings a clone of Wolverine that has blood that releases light when consumed by Vampires.  The vampire's consume the blood from the Wolverine clone.  Shortly after consumption, they begin to die.  Wolverine and Louise attack the dying vampires.  In the carnage, Dracula escapes.

Wolverine brings Louise to the realm of Vampires where Death, from Arakko, currently resides.  Louise makes a case to the realm of vampires for assistance in addressing the growing threat of the vampire nation on Earth.  Death's response suggests that he and his host may look favourably upon Louise's request due to Dracula's behaviour.

## Thoughts

The art was consistent and fine.  Still partially about vampires, and still not thrilled about it.
