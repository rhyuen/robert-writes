# A Difference between .bashrc and .bash_profile

`.bash_profile` is only run each time you login to your computer.

`.bashrc` is run every each time a bash instance is started.

You can reload your `.bashrc` file via command line using the following methods:

```bash
> $ ~/.bashrc

# or 

> $ source ~/.bashrc
```
