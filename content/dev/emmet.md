I saw this [here](https://web.dev/codelab-building-a-stories-component/) and thought it was pretty cool.  More specifically, it was in the video at [1:36](https://youtu.be/PzvdREGR0Xw).

.stores>section.user*3>article.story*3

I typed in 'emmet' in the vscode extensions tab and downloaded the one with the most downloads.
