It seems you can monetization web pages using a new developing web browser standard.  It's only one `<meta/>` tag.

It takes the form as follow:

```html
    <meta name="monetization" content="direction/to/your/wallet/account">
```

I ended up using [uphold.com](https://uphold.com), but I had to jump through a few hoops to get the key address for my wallet.  I had to search for tutorial on how to generate the key to the wallet.  There are two ways.  One each with the new and old GUIs.  I couldn't figure it out on the new one so I had to switch to their old GUI to get the key generated.  I've yet to deploy the demo site with the key, so I'll perhaps report back with the results in the distant/near future.
