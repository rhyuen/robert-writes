I was looking for the documentation for Validator and searched for 'validatorjs' and got the docs for it.  I thought it looked kind of [odd](https://www.npmjs.com/package/validatorjs).  I looked them up not too long ago and noticed that they updated relatively recently (December 2020).  And I thought that's odd. The documentation looks different from before.  

Turns out there are two libraries that do more or less the samething with very similar names:

Validator (the one I normally use) [Source](https://www.npmjs.com/package/validator)

and

ValidatorJS [Source](https://www.npmjs.com/package/validatorjs)
