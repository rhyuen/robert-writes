                <p>Also, I needed a new new year's resolution and I noticed that I've been forgetting things and recording things and having a log of what you've learned and the contexts in which you've learned it seems like it might be nice to have.</p>
                <p>Grammar and spelling mistakes are expected and likely will not be corrected.  This is more an exercise in developing a creation habit than having everything be perfect and well done.</p>

                <p>I finally styled the site after three years.</p>
                <p>I based a lot of styling on Medium's site styling.</p>
                <p>This should probably go in another section.</p>
